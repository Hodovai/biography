        Svante Pääbo (born 20 April 1955 )is a  Swedish
         geneticticistand Nobel Laureate who specialisses
         in the field of evolutionary genetics,As one 
         of the founders of paleogenetics, he has worked
          extensively on the Neanderthal genome. In 1997, 
         he became founding director of the Department
          of Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for 
          Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.
          Since 1999, he has been an honorary professor at 
          Leipzig University; he currently teaches molecular 
          evolutionary biology 
          at the university. He is also an adjunct
           professor at Okinawa Institute of Science 
           and Technology, Japan.

      Pääbo is known as one of the founders of paleogenetics, a discipline that uses genetics to study early humans and other ancient species.

In year 1986 to 1987, he did postdoctoral research at the Institute for Molecular Biology II, University of Zurich, Switzerland

As an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow, Pääbo moved to the United States in 1987, accepting a position as a postdoctoral researcher in biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, where he joined Allan Wilson's lab and worked on the genome of extinct mammals.


 In 1997, he became founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.Pääbo and colleagues
  reported their successful sequencing of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), originating from a specimen found in Feldhofer grotto in the Neander valley.

In August 2002, Pääbo's department published findings about the "language gene", FOXP2, which is mutated in some individuals with language disabilities.

 Pääbo announced a plan in 2006 to reconstruct the entire genome of Neanderthals.

February 2009, at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Chicago, it was announced that the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology had completed the first draft version of the Neanderthal genome. Over 3 billion base pairs were sequenced in collaboration with the 454 Life Sciences Corporation.

In March 2010, Pääbo and his coworkers published a report about the DNA analysis of a finger bone found in the Denisova Cave in Siberia; the results suggest that the bone belonged to an extinct member of the genus Homo that had not yet been recognised, the Denisova hominin. 
Pääbo first wanted to classify the Denisovans as a species of their own, separate from modern humans and Neanderthals but changed his mind after peer-review.

Pääbo's doctoral student Viviane Slon was able to successfully map the Denisovan genome, clarifying geographic distribution and admixtures in archaic humans.

In 2020, Pääbo determined that more severe impacts upon victims of the COVID-19 disease, including the vulnerability to it and the incidence of the necessity of hospitalisation,
 have been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with European Neanderthal heritage. 
 That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease.The findings are from Pääbo and researchers he leads at the Planck Institute and the Karolinska Institutet.

      <!-- Awards and honors content here -->
      He received the 2022  Nobel Prize in 
Physiology or Medicine "for his discoveries concerning 
the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution".

In 1992, he received the 1992 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,
 which is the highest honour awarded in German research. Pääbo was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
  in 2000, and in 2004 was elected an international member of the National Academy of Sciences.
   In 2005, he received the prestigious Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine and
   he received the  2008 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.
    In October 2009, the Foundation For the Future announced that Pääbo had been awarded the 2009 Kistler Prize for his work 
    isolating and sequencing ancient DNA, beginning in 1984 with a 2,400-year-old mummy.
     In June 2010, the Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS) awarded him the Theodor Bücher Medal 
     for outstanding achievements in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[50] In 2013, he received Gruber Prize in Genetics 
     for groundbreaking research in evolutionary genetics. In June 2015, he was awarded the degree of DSc (honoris causa) at NUI Galway.
      He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 2016 and also in 2017, was awarded the Dan David Prize.
       In 2018, he received the Princess of Asturias Awards in the category of Scientific Research, in 2020 the Japan Prize,
        in 2021 the Massry Prize[54] and in 2022 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for sequencing the first Neanderthal genome.
